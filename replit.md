✅ **RESOLVED: Critical VAT calculation bug causing incorrect tax amounts in orders and PDFs**
- **Issue**: VAT calculation was incorrect - VAT rate 0.06 (6%) was being divided by 100 again, resulting in 0.0006 rate
- **Root Cause**: calculateOrderTaxes function was treating database rate as percentage and dividing by 100 unnecessarily

- **Code Fix**: 
  - Removed unnecessary division by 100 in vatRate calculation
  - Fixed return value to properly convert decimal to percentage for display (0.06 * 100 = 6%)

✅ **RESOLVED: Fixed CRM Dashboard top customers to show accurate real-time data from order calculations**
- **Issue**: CRM Dashboard was displaying incorrect top customers data due to using outdated stored values in crm_customers.total_spent (all showing 0.00)
- **Root Cause**: CRM customers table had stored analytics fields (total_spent, total_orders_count) that were not being updated with actual order data
- **Investigation**: Database analysis revealed live order data existed in customer_orders table with accurate amounts (ABAS ABASI: 613,966.79 IQD, Omid Mohammad: 212,102.59 IQD, etc.)
- **Solution**: Modified getCrmDashboardStats() in crm-storage.ts to use live calculation from customer_orders table instead of stored values

  - Changed topCustomers query to JOIN crm_customers with customer_orders table
  - Added real-time SUM(total_amount) calculation for accurate spending amounts  
  - Used COUNT(orders.id) for precise order counts

### COMPLETED: Customer Profile Cost Breakdown Fix - Separated Items Subtotal from Shipping (July 22, 2025)
✅ **RESOLVED: Fixed incorrect subtotal calculation in customer profile order display**

- **Example**: Order with items 22.00 + 11.00 = 33.00 IQD + 18000.00 IQD shipping was showing items subtotal as 18033.00 IQD
- **Root Cause**: `subtotalAmount = totalAmount - vatAmount - shippingCost - surchargeAmount` was mathematically wrong
- **Solution**: Changed to calculate from actual order items: `order.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.totalPrice, 0)`
- **Impact**: Items subtotal now shows correct sum of product prices (33.00 IQD) separate from shipping (18000.00 IQD)
- **Display Order**: Items subtotal → Shipping cost → VAT (if > 0) → Total with proper separation
- **Result**: Customer profile now displays accurate cost breakdown with items and shipping properly separated

  - Current VAT rate: 6% (rate=0.0600 in tax_settings)
  - Historical orders show varied VAT calculation accuracy due to past system changes
  - Example: Order M2511166 has 0.04 IQD VAT on 58.39 total (historically calculated)
- **User Experience**: Customer profile now shows complete financial breakdown per order in logical order:
  1. مجموع اقلام (Items Subtotal) - calculated automatically
  2. هزینه حمل (Shipping Cost) - always displayed from order data
  3. مالیات بر ارزش افزوده (VAT Amount) - from historical order data (only shows if amount > 0)
  4. عوارض (Surcharges) - if applicable
  5. مجموع کل (Grand Total) - with separator line and bold formatting
- **Enhanced Display**: Shipping cost now always visible (even when 0.00), VAT hidden when zero, professional formatting with color-coding
