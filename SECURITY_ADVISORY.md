# CRITICAL SECURITY ADVISORY

## Vulnerability Details
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Issue:** Exposed admin credentials and password reset tokens in database backup file  
**Files Affected:** `database_backup.sql`  
**Date Discovered:** June 13, 2025  

## What Was Exposed
- Admin user credentials (usernames, emails, bcrypt password hashes)
- Password reset tokens and associated email addresses
- User account creation and modification timestamps

## Immediate Actions Taken
✅ Removed sensitive user data from `database_backup.sql`  
✅ Replaced exposed credentials with security notice comments  

## Required Actions Before Deployment

### 1. Change All Admin Passwords
```sql
-- Connect to your production database and run:
UPDATE users SET password_hash = $NEW_BCRYPT_HASH WHERE email = 'info@momtazchem.com';
UPDATE users SET password_hash = $NEW_BCRYPT_HASH WHERE email = 'mr.ghafari@gmail.com';
```

### 2. Invalidate All Password Reset Tokens
```sql
-- Clear all existing password reset tokens:
DELETE FROM password_resets;
```

### 3. Recreate Admin Users Manually
After deploying the cleaned database backup, create new admin accounts:
- Use the admin interface or API endpoints
- Generate strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication if available

### 4. Security Audit Checklist
- [ ] Verify no other backup files contain sensitive data
- [ ] Check git history for exposed credentials
- [ ] Review access logs for unauthorized login attempts
- [ ] Update all API keys and secrets
- [ ] Implement database backup encryption for future backups

### 5. Monitor for Suspicious Activity
- Watch for failed login attempts with old credentials
- Monitor for unusual database access patterns
- Set up alerts for admin account activities

## Prevention Measures
1. **Never include user tables in version-controlled backups**
2. **Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration**
3. **Implement automated credential rotation**
4. **Encrypt all database backups**
5. **Use `.gitignore` for backup files and logs**
